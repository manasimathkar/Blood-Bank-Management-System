# Blood-Bank-Management-System

## Project Description
This project focused on creating an Android app to streamline the blood donation process, using Java and integrating advanced Google Cloud technologies for optimal functionality. By employing Google Cloud Functions, the app offered real-time data management and serverless operations, enhancing the efficiency of donor-recipient connections. User authentication and database management were handled through Firebase Firestore, while the Google Maps API facilitated easy localization of hospitals and donors. The development utilized key skills in Java, Firebase Firestore, Google Cloud Functions, and Google Maps API, alongside tools like Android Studio and the Android SDK. This solution not only leveraged technology to support public health initiatives but also simplified the process of blood donation, making it more accessible and efficient.

This group project was completed as a component of the Python development course, a curriculum requirement for our bachelor's degree.
